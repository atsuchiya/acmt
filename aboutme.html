				<h2> From mauka... to makai... to Miami </h2>
				<p>
				Hi! I'm Ariana Tsuchiya and welcome to my online portfolio! I am an expected graduate of the University of Miami and will be acquiring my Masters in Business Administration in May 2014. My major is marketing and I also have a minor in Visual Journalism. As a Miami Hurricane, I have a love of football, school spirit, and all things orange and green!
				</p>
				<p>
				Although I currently reside in Miami, I am originally from Honolulu, Hawaii. Growing up in Hawaii has taught me the importance of being active, sustainable, and staying healthy. To this day, I still enjoy hiking, surfing, and paddle boarding. While living on the island of Oahu, I also found my passion of photography. Photography started as a way for me to share what I love with those I love. Now, I use photography to capture moments for everyone from anywhere I am in the world!
				</p>
				<p>
				Being a girl born and raised on the island, I found myself also wanting to travel and experience everything the world has to offer. I have taught English in Baojing, China, studied abroad in Rome, Italy, and have had many adventures in between.
				</p>
				<p>
				Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
